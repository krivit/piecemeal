\title{piecemeal: A package for wrangling large simulations}
\description{
The goal of 'piecemeal' is to simplify running simulation studies made up of many relatively small replications and treatment configurations in a setting (such as a shared a computing cluster) in which the parallel processing may be interrupted due to time limits, errors, or for other reasons.
}
\details{
This package grew out of a common problem of running a simulation with large numbers of treatment combinations and replications on a shared computing cluster. Using available tools such as \pkg{parallel} and even \CRANpkg{foreach} can be frustrating for a number of reasons:
\itemize{
\item If any of the function runs results in an error, all results are lost.
\item Tracking down which configuration resulted in an error and reproducing it can be frustrating, and if the fix does not fix all the errors, one has to start over.
\item If one underestimates the amount of time all the jobs will take, all results are lost.
\item Conversely, if the cluster is freer than anticipated, it is desirable to queue another job to get things done twice as fast.
}

Those package with fault-tolerance capabilities typically focus on crashing worker nodes.

This can be worked around in a variety of ways. Functions can be wrapped in \code{\link[=try]{try()}}. Rather than returning the result to the manager process, the worker can save its results to a unique file, with the results collated at the end. \code{\link{Piecemeal}} automates this, and keeps careful track of inputs and random seeds, ensuring that problematic realisations can be located and debugged quickly and efficiently. A locking system even makes it possible to have multiple jobs running the same study on the same cluster without interfering with each other.
